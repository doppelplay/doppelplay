# Kickoff meeting doppelplay


Present @ Slack call, 2017-11-11 15:00 CET:

* Werner
* Runar
* Peter
* Alan
* Roy


## Decisions

* We have decided on the language learning by lyrics project, because 
that offers the best React challenge.
* We need to keep the project small to make sure we actually deliver
a product. No user-community initially.
* This is a learning project for all of us, so we should not shy 
away from new technologies.
* The project will require a REST backend, which will be written in 
NodeJS
* We will work in sprints with smaller teams. Everybody in the meeting 
has time to work on this in the coming weeks.
* Werner and Peter will work on the REST server.
* Roy and Alan on the requirements & UI design.
* Runar will be involved in both (perhaps as "product owner"?)

## Tasks
* ~~|Roy|~~ Initiate a Github repository with a readme describing 
the project.
* ~~|Roy|~~ Make a Trello team with initial boards
* |ALL| Add contact data to google doc, so I can add you to Trello 
and Github.
* |???| Formulate general requirements
* |???| Make general planning of sprints
* |Roy| Set up the agile/scrum board in Trello for the sprints.

From now on, I will keep the tasks in Trello.

## Miscellaneous
I did some research on what we can use for this project (information 
sources, projects to use or fork). Here are some interesting things:

* [react-player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player) and 
[react-jplayer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jplayer) are 
media components that we could probably directly use in the app;
* [react-jplaylist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jplaylist) 
is a media browser that we can use for inspiration
* [lyrics-wikia.com](http://lyrics-wikia.com) has an API that serves lyrics
* [lyricstranslate.com](http://lyricstranslate.com/) website is not
much too look at, but there is a ton of translated lyrics.

## What's next?
In the next couple of days, I will formulate requirements and make 
a picture of what I had in mind with this app. I hope that one of 
you can help me out with this. It should be done by Wednesday. After 
that we will have a clear picture of what to work on and we can kick 
off the sprints.
